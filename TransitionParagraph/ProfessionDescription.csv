en_Assassin,Cursed from birth with unnatural sorcery, assassins are often exiled in childhood.  Forced to the streets to fend for themselves, they develop a unique fighting style that blends grace with magic unburdened by morality.  Now grown, they serve as the great equalizers, plying their deadly trade without regard for station or standing.
en_Bard,Once upon a time, bards were wandering musicians, minstrels playing for an evening meal.  But no longer.  Bards are wizards with swords, fighters with spells.  Bards can master every trick, learn every move, and do it all with grace and style.  Quick, clever, strong, and still a wild hit at parties, today's bard is the ultimate adventurer.
en_Dragon,Merciless.  Beautiful.  Wise.  Cruel.  Ancient beyond human imagining, dragons care little for the lesser races.  Driven by unfathomable goals, these timeless champions swiftly deal with any opposition.
en_Druid,An avatar of nature, the druid wields a mercurial magic.  She can summon raging tempests, command feral hordes, and rend even the stoutest armor with her own claws.  But such great power carries an equal cost: frequent, bloody accidents leave druids outcast from civilized society.
en_Monk,Followers of a secret order, monks devote their lives to mastering their bodies.  Through perfect control of the physical, they seek communion with the divine.  While their combat abilities and healing spells make them fantastic allies in combat, many adventurers secretly prefer monk companions for their vow of poverty.
en_Necromancer,Masters of life and death, necromancers epitomize magical study.  By fusing the divine and the arcane, these practitioners have developed mastery over their own mortality.  No longer destined to die, they live out their long existences in solitude, the vampirism that feeds their eternal life making them unwelcome in civilized society.  Well, either the vampirism or the everpresent carrion odor.
en_Paladin,Crusaders and champions of justice, paladins combine an affinity for swordplay with potent healing spells.  Welcome allies on the battlefield, these warriors of the light never stay still.  Some suggest it is their desire to purge evil; most believe their constant moral criticism prevent them from finding a home.
en_Professor,Some come to the dungeon in search of power.  Some in search of fame.  Most in search of wealth.  The professor's motivations are equally simple: he comes to study the wildlife.  A fascination with nature in all its bizarre forms has led him to forsake hearth and home to explore this dangerous frontier.
en_Ranger,Far from civilization lurk mighty monsters: lizards as large as buildings, birds that breathe fire, and motes of light that will steal your soul.  But one creature is greater still: strong as the oak, graceful as the wind, and cunning as the fox, rangers are the most fearsome beasts in the wild.
en_Samurai,Peerless warriors focused on honing body and mind into perfect weapons.  Masters of swordplay and magic, they effortless weave both disciplines into a seamless dance.  Some see this split focus as unnecessary and even self-defeating, but those who say so publicly rarely have the opportunity to repeat themselves.
zh_Assassin,从出生起便被诅咒，具有不自然的巫术能力，刺客通常在童年时被流放。被迫流落街头，自生自灭，他们发展出一种独特的战斗风格，将优雅与魔法结合，却不受道德约束。如今，他们已经长大，成为伟大的平衡者，在不顾地位或身份的情况下进行致命的交易。
zh_Bard,曾几何时，吟游诗人是流浪的音乐家，夜晚为一顿晚餐而演奏。但如今，吟游诗人是持剑的巫师，施法的战士。吟游诗人可以掌握每一个技巧，学习每一个动作，且做到优雅与风格并重。机敏、聪明、强大，依然在聚会中成为焦点，今天的吟游诗人是终极冒险者。

zh_Druid,作为大自然的化身，德鲁伊操控变幻莫测的魔法。她能够召唤狂暴的风暴，指挥野性部落，甚至用自己的利爪撕裂最坚固的盔甲。但如此强大的力量也带来相应的代价：频繁的血腥事故使得德鲁伊被文明社会所排斥。
zh_Monk,作为一个秘密教团的追随者，武僧一生致力于掌控自己的身体。通过对身体的完美控制，他们寻求与神明的沟通。虽然他们的战斗能力和治疗法术使他们成为战斗中的出色盟友，但许多冒险者私下里更喜欢武僧作为伙伴，因为他们的贫困誓言。
zh_Necromancer,生命与死亡的掌控者，死灵法师是魔法研究的化身。通过将神圣与奥术融合，这些修行者已达到了对自己死亡的掌控。他们不再注定死去，而是过上了孤独的长寿生活，吸血症使得他们在文明社会中不受欢迎。嗯，不管是吸血症，还是随身带来的腐臭味。
zh_Paladin,十字军与正义的捍卫者，圣骑士将剑术与强大的治疗法术结合。作为战场上的受欢迎盟友，这些光明的战士永不停歇。有人认为他们的目的是净化邪恶；但大多数人认为，是他们不断的道德批评让他们难以安定下来。
zh_Professor,有些人来到地下城寻求力量，有些人寻求名声，大多数人则寻求财富。教授的动机同样简单：他来这里是为了研究野生动物。对大自然各种奇异形态的迷恋使他舍弃了家园，投身于探索这个危险的前沿。
zh_Ranger,远离文明的地方，隐藏着强大的怪物：体型如建筑的蜥蜴，喷火的鸟类，以及会偷走灵魂的光点。但有一种生物更为强大：如橡树般坚韧，如风般优雅，如狐狸般狡猾，游侠是野外最可怕的猎手。
zh_Samurai,无与伦比的战士，致力于将身体与心智锻造为完美的武器。剑术与魔法的双重大师，他们将两者无缝结合，像舞蹈般流畅。有人认为这种分裂的专注是多余的，甚至是自我挫败的，但那些公开这样说的人，通常没有机会再说出第二句话。
en_Priest,Spiritual guides.  Teachers.  Scholars.  Priests are the heart of the adventuring party.  Versatile spellcasters equally comfortable with healing the sick, protecting the weak, and burning the heretical, priests are not to be trifled with.
zh_Priest,精神导师，教师，学者……牧师们扮演的角色往往是一个冒险团队中的核心。多才多艺的施术者在治愈疾病、保护弱者和焚烧异端上同样游刃有余。牧师是不容小觑的。
en_Random,Not all adventurers are decisive.  Some are as fickle and capricious as the gods, their passions shifting with the tides.  These wild souls inexorably find themselves drawn here, gleefully pledging their lives to the whims of Fate.
zh_Random,并非所有冒险家都是果断的。他们中的一些就像诸神般反复无常，他们的激情犹如潮汐般时涨时落。这些狂野的灵魂无情地发现自己被吸引到此处，于是他们兴高采烈地向命运无常抵押上自己的生命。
en_Thief,Rogues, scoundrels, and ne'er-do-wells, the path of the thief is rarely anyone's first choice.  But a harsh life has prepared them well for adventuring: their legendary speed alongside a variety of tricks makes thieves excellent additions to any adventuring party.  At least until it's time to divide the gold.
zh_Thief,无赖、恶棍和无名小卒，很少有人天生志在成为氓流。但严酷的生活让他们早就对冒险做好了充分的准备：他们拥有传奇般的敏捷和速度，加上各种各样的技巧。盗贼无疑可以成为任何冒险团队中的精英份子。至少直到他们分赃之前。
en_Warrior,Warriors revel in combat.  The rush of blood, the surge of adrenaline: these are the warrior's passions.  What they lack in subtlety warriors make up for with pure power and resilience.
zh_Warrior,战士们热衷于战斗。血气涌动，激素飙升，这是战士的激情！他们用纯粹的力量和韧性填补在精雕细琢方面的欠缺。
en_Wizard,Masters of magic, wizards make up for a lack of power with extreme versatility.  Able to conjure meteors, stop time, and disappear from view, there is little an experienced and prepared mage can't do.  Except find his glasses.
zh_Wizard,法师们深谙魔法之道，他们除了身体羸弱之外掌握着繁多能力。召唤流星，停止事件，隐藏身形……一个经验老道并且准备充足的法师几乎无所不能。啊，除了找到他的眼镜。
