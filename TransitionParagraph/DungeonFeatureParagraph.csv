en_treasureChest_content,While exploring the dungeon you come across an old treasure chest.  Just looking at it, you know beyond a shadow of doubt that it is filled to the brim with delicious goodies.  Visions of donuts, chocolate truffles, and candy canes dance through your mind as you bend to open the chest.  Slowly, you raise the lid and stare at the inside. \\n Nothing.  Not even a crumb. \\n Obviously, you cannot stand for this outrage.  Furious, you draw your sword and rend the chest to pieces.  \\n Huh, maybe there was something hidden in the lining.  Or you just got a little better at breaking things.
zh_treasureChest_content,在探索地下城时，你偶然发现了一只古老的宝箱。光是看到它这外观，你就毫不怀疑其中装满了美味的珍宝。你脑海中浮现出甜甜圈、巧克力松露和糖果手杖的画面，于是你弯腰准备打开宝箱。你慢慢地抬起箱盖，屏气凝神地往宝箱里看去。 \\n什么都没有。甚至连一块小饼干也没有。\\n你当然不能容忍这种侮辱！你拔出剑，并愤怒地将宝箱劈成了碎片。 \\n呃，也许里面真有些隐藏的东西。或者你只是变得更擅长破坏东西了。
en_blacksmith_content,Bright pink letters adorn one of the walls of the dungeon: "Insert Coin to Continue."  Curious, you investigate further.  There is a slit in the wall, about the size of a gold piece, as well as a greyed out picture of an anvil.  As you watch, the letters jumble again, now spelling out: "Ok.  One time free."  The anvil icon lights up and begins flashing wildly.  I guess it wouldn't hurt to experiment...
zh_blacksmith_content,眼前的地牢墙壁上，几个明亮的粉色字母拼接出一句话：“插入硬币以继续”。出于好奇，你在进一步打量着这面墙壁。墙上有一道缝隙，刚好够一块金币塞进去，还有一块灰色的铁砧图标。当你再度抬头看向先前的字母，那些字母开始打乱重组出一句新的话：“好的。一次免费的机会。”铁砧图标亮起，并开始疯狂闪烁。我猜，试试也无妨……
en_healingpool_content,In the middle of the floor lies an enormous pool.  Cautious, you start to tiptoe around the outside edge when the waters begin to rile.  Ripples form, emanating from the center where a sharp tip begins to breach the water.  Slowly, a long blade follows, attached to a dainty hand, then bright red hair and a snow white face.  When the nymph rising from the waves catches sight of you she frowns.  "Oh.  That's not at all who I was expecting.  What are you doing here?"\\n You stammer something foolishly.\\n "Yeah, whatever.  Look, you can drink some of the water - it'll make you feel better.  But you're going to have to pay me for anything you use.  Just toss the coin into the water - I'm going to take a nap."
zh_healingpool_content,在地板中央有一个巨大的水池。当水开始沸腾时，你小心翼翼的踮起脚尖绕过水池的边缘。一个尖锐的物体从水面中心露出，并伴随着水面的阵阵波纹。一只精致的手划开水流，从水中缓缓升起。当鲜红的头发和雪白的脸颊浮上水面时，你意识到这是湖中仙子。当这位随海浪升起的仙女看到你时，她皱起了眉头：“哦，这可完全不是我想的那样。你在这里干什么？”\\n你结结巴巴地说了些傻话。“好吧，无所谓了。听着，你可以和一些湖水——这湖水能疗愈身心。但你用了什么都要付钱给我。你问怎么支付？喏，你只要把硬币投到水里就行了。现在，别再打扰我了，我还要睡午觉呢。”
en_healingpool_firstText,\\n"Well, you know what?  This is your first time, so I guess you can have some for free.  Just don't expect anything else from me."
zh_healingpool_firstText,\\n“嗯……好吧，你猜怎么着？你是头一次光顾这里，所以你可以免费享用一次服务。但你可别指望下次还有例外。”
en_lichhunter_content,While exploring the old catacombs you come across an old man, desperately clutching a cross and muttering feverishly.  Obviously a pre-zombie, you draw your sword and prepare to end his pre-misery.  "Living, listen!" He cries, throwing open his arms.  "Igor has much to teach you!  Lich not die - Igor teach you how!"\n\nThis seems like a pretty specific skill, but who knows, it might come in handy...
zh_lichhunter_content,在探索古老的地下墓穴之时，你意外撞见一个老人。这位老人紧抓着一把十字架，狂热地嘟囔着。这显然是尸变前兆（pre-zombie），你拔剑准备结束他的“苦难前兆”。“活着，听着！”他叫喊着，张开了双臂“伊戈尔有很多东西要教给你！巫妖不会死亡——伊戈尔教你怎么做！”\\n\\n这似乎是一项十分独特的技能，但谁知道呢，万一它派上用场……
en_monastery_content,Deep in the dungeon you stumble across a surprise.  Leaning against one of the walls is a cardboard cutout; a painted church in gaudy blue.  On a whim you try the painted doorknob, but to your surprise, the door, along with the wall behind it, parts.  Curious now, you walk into an almost empty room.  Sitting cross-legged against the far wall is a man.  Long, scraggly hair obscures his face, but he stands as you enter. \\n "Welcome, traveller.  Have you come to forget your past?" \\n Then he grins.  "The first time is free." \\n It seems like he might be able to help you forget.  But no one in this dungeon does things for free; something tells you the cost will increase each time you take advantage of this offer.
zh_monastery_content,在地牢深处，你偶然发现一个惊喜。一块被裁切过的硬纸板靠着墙壁：一座绘制出的艳蓝色教堂。你突然心血来潮，尝试去拧涂着油漆的门把手，然而门和后面的墙壁都只是散件。你好奇地走进一个几乎空荡的房间，只有一个男人盘腿靠着墙壁坐着。长而凌乱的头发遮住了他的脸庞，但看到你进入房间时他站了起来。\\n“欢迎你，旅行者。你是来遗忘过去的吗？”\\n他笑了笑，说：“第一次免费。”\\n似乎，他拥有令人遗忘的力量。但这个地牢里可没有会做慈善：一种预感告诉你，每次你使用这个力量，成本都会增加。

en_shop_content,Exploring the otherwise dark and dreary dungeon, you come upon a small house.  Built not from bricks or stone but from gingerbread and gumdrops, it immediately draws you in. \\n On entering, you meet the owner, a goblin woman, stooped with age. "Care for some candy?"  she asks. "Or would you prefer one of our delicious treats?  Guaranteed to expand your mind!"
zh_shop_content,在探索黑暗而沉闷的地牢时，你意外发现一座小房子。这座房子不是用砖石堆砌，而是用姜饼和秋葵做成的。这立刻吸引了你。\\n 一进门，你就遇到了这个房子的主人：一个年老驼背的精灵妇女。“想吃糖果吗？”她问道，“还是说，您更喜欢我们的其他美味？保证能让你心胸开阔！”
en_smoothieShack_content,Behind a long table in the middle of the hallway sits a little girl.  Blonde hair in pigtails she smiles as you approach.  "Oh goodie!  An adventurer!  Would you like some lemonade?"  She gestures in front of her to several different colored pitchers. \\n "They're delicious - I promise! And you can even have one for free!"\\n You're not one to let a little girl down, so maybe you'd like to try one?
zh_smoothieShack_content,走廊中央的一张长桌后面坐着一个有着金发长辫的小女孩。当你走近时，她向你微笑道：“哇哦！太棒了！一个冒险家！你想要喝点柠檬水吗？”她向放在她对面的几个不同颜色瓶子做了个手势。\\n“我保证它们都很好喝！你甚至可以免费尝一个！”\\n你可不是一个会让小女孩失望的人，所以，你要试试吗？
en_levelStart_buildIntroText,"So nice of you to join us, master."  As your eyes finally adjust to the light and catch sight of the speaker, you quickly close them again.  Tentatively you open them slowly and stare at the hideous creature floating in front of you.  Maybe a foot tall, like an enormous red bat with leathery wings, horns, and a spiked tail, the imp sneers at you.\\n"So, are you ready to go?  We've got monsters to kill and corpses to loot!"\\n\\n
zh_levelStart_buildIntroText,“你能加入我们真是太好了！大师。”当你的眼睛终于适应了周围的光线，你看到了正在说话的“人”。你不可置信的闭上眼睛，又再次缓缓睁眼——眼前还是刚才那个恐怖的生物。一只小恶魔，身高不到半米，外貌就像一只巨大的红色蝙蝠，还长着坚韧的翅膀、脚和尖尖的尾巴。它此刻正嘲弄的看着你。\\n“那么，你准备好了吗？我们还有怪物要杀，有尸体要掠夺呢。”\\n\\n
en_levelStart_waterText,You start to take note of your surroundings and gasp in fear: water surrounds you, filling your lungs.  You try to scream but can only burble.  "Come on, just breathe - it's not that hard"”.  You don't want to drown, but there's not much choice in the matter.  Screwing up your eyes, you tentatively open your mouth.  "Hey!  I'm alive!"  The imp just snickers and rolls his eyes.\\n\\nYou briefly consider cutting off his head, but are momentarily distracted by a faint song: 
zh_levelStart_waterText,你开始注意到周围的环境，战栗着，喘息着：水包围着你，灌满了你的肺。你试图尖叫，但只打了个嗝。“来吧，只是呼吸而已，没那么难的”。 你不想淹死，但就眼下的情况而言，似乎没有第二种选择。你紧闭双眼，嘴巴微张。“嘿！我还活着！”小恶魔只是偷笑，翻了个白眼。\\n\\n你顿时想到要不要把他的头拿下来当球踢，但被远处传来的微弱歌声分散了注意力：
en_levelStart_volcanoText,Groggily, you take note of your surroundings.  It’s hot, almost furnace-like, and the ground beneath you is moving.  In fact, all around you mini volcanoes erupt every few seconds, rivers of lava running past your feet.  Foul-smelling smoke fills the air stinging your eyes and burning your nose. \\n\\nBut from the gurgling of the lava you can make out a faint voice: 
zh_levelStart_volcanoText,你迷迷糊糊地环顾四周，发现这里天气炎热，仿若身处火炉之中。你脚下的地面正在移动。事实上，你周围的小火山每隔几秒就会喷发一次。熔岩河流从你的脚下流过。空气中弥漫着恶臭的烟雾，刺痛拿到双眼，灼伤你的鼻腔。\\n\\n除了熔岩流动的潺潺声，你还能发出微弱的声音：
en_levelStart_forestText,Looking around, you just see trees.  As tall and as far as the eye can see.  You try to find your bearings, but the trees seem to shift as you watch them and you have no idea where you are.  Twigs snap beneath your every step and you fear that each sound might annoy one of the dark shapes lurking just out of view.\\n\\nFrom the rustling of the leaves, though, you can make out distant words: 
zh_levelStart_forestText,树木，树木，树木，你环顾四周，抬头仰望，举目远眺，只能看见密集的参天巨木。你试图确定自己的位置，但当你盯着一棵树时，你发现这些树似乎都在移动。这使得你无法确定自己身在何处。你的每一步脚下都有细枝，这使你不得不担忧踩碎细枝的细小声音会不会惹恼到隐藏在视线之外的，阴影之中的怪物。\\n\\n不过，从树叶的沙沙声中，你听到遥远的话语：
en_levelStart_dungeonText,Your surroundings are drab.  Grey stone walls, grey stone floor, grey stone dust on every surface.  Each time you inhale, it tickles your nose, but you fight hard not to sneeze: there are a myriad of footprints outlined on the floor and you'd rather not alert them to your presence.  Gripping your weapon tightly, you shrug.  A dungeon isn't the most glamorous of settings, but a hero has to go where the monsters are.\\n\\nAs you turn to go, you catch sight of a note stuck to the wall: 
zh_levelStart_dungeonText,灰墙，灰地板，灰石头，灰尘。你的周围尽是单调的灰色。每次你吸气时，这些弥散在空气中的尘埃都会让你的鼻子发痒。但你努力克制着自己想要打喷嚏的想法：看那地板上无数奇形怪状的脚印，你可不想那些东西被惊扰。你握紧了自己的武器，耸了耸肩。地牢并非什么旅游胜地，但英雄们必须前往怪物所在之处。\\n\\n当你转身离去时，你看到墙壁上贴着一张纸条：
en_levelStart_skyText,Everything around you is filled with light - the only break is in the fluffy white clouds that tickle your nose as they pass by.  Wait, clouds?  Foolishly you look down into nothing - only sky as far as the eye can see.  You wave your arms wildly, hoping that can somehow keep you from plummeting to your doom.  Your companion laughs at your predicament.  "Hey genius, if you weren't falling already, did you really think a chicken dance was going to help?"  Huh, I guess you're not falling after all.  On the downside, it looks like all those monsters aren't falling either.\\n\\n A voice carries to you over the light breeze: 
zh_levelStart_skyText,你周围的一切都充斥着光芒，唯有蓬松的白云例外。当它们经过时，它们会轻轻摩挲着你的鼻子。等下，哪来的云？你傻傻地向下看去，但什么也没有——除了眼睛能看到的天空。你疯狂挥动手臂，希望借此阻止自己从空中跌落。你的同伴嘲笑你的困境。“嘿，天才，如果你还没有掉下去，你真认为摆动你的胳膊会有什么作用吗？”嗯，我想你确实没掉下去。从另一个角度看，所有云上的怪物也不会掉下去。\\n\\n微风中传来一个声音：
en_levelStart_CryptText,"OOOOOOOOooooooo".  A haunting echo fills the air as a faint breeze makes the hair on the back of your neck stand up.  Faint shapes drift across the corners of your vision, gone when you try to catch them.  And a musty mix of death and cobwebs taints every breath.  "Come on boss, you just going to stand there?  We've got work to do."  The obnoxious imp is right and so, with some trepidation, you cautiously begin to explore.\\n\\nAs you become more accustomed to the wails and howls around you, you start to pick out meaning from the noise: 
zh_levelStart_CryptText,“呜呜呜呜呜呜呜~~”。当微风拂过你后颈的头发，空气中弥漫着挥之不去的回声。模糊的形状从你的视野中飘过，但当你试图抓住它们时，它们就消失了。死亡和蜘蛛网的霉味混杂在一起，污染着你的每一次呼吸。“来吧，老大，你要就这么呆站在那里吗？我们还有活要干呢。”讨厌的小恶魔是对的，因此，你开始迈着颤抖的步伐，小心翼翼地探索。\\n\\n当你越来越适应周围的哀嚎和嚎叫时，你开始从这些噪音中分辨出它们的意思：
en_levelStart_buildFinalBossText,Beware the Lord of the Dream.  He has {BossAdj}  {BossNoun} and {BossPhrase}.

When finally you can take it no more, they are suddenly gone, replaced with a blinding white light.\\n\\nYour eyes slowly adjust and you look around.

But this plane of light ain't big enough for two of you, so the time has come to put an end to this madness.
zh_levelStart_endText,你沿着蜿蜒的楼梯慢慢步入黑暗，走了五六公里仍没到头。当你终于无法忍受时，楼梯和黑暗瞬间全部消失，取而代之的是一道耀眼的白光。\\n\\n当你的眼睛终于适应了这里的光线，你环顾四周。没有烦人的小恶魔，也没有地面——你目光所及之处空无一物。只有同样明亮的光。哦，还有一个人，一个正坐在王座上的人。\\n\\n当你朝他走去时，你认出了那个人：是你！但这地方容不下两个你，是时候结束这场疯狂的闹剧了。
en_mushroompatch_init,As you stomp through this floor, you hear something squish beneath your boot.  Looking down, you're surrounded by small, bright red mushrooms, as far as the eye can see.  Or at least for a couple of feet - it is pretty dark in here.  "Wait!  Wait!  Wait!"  A wrinkled face, topped with crazy white hair peers out at you from the gloom.  "Those are magic mushrooms.  My magic red mushrooms!" \\n "Ummm.  Ok....Can I have one?" \\n "No!  My mushrooms!  I know a secret though.  He leans in conspiratorially.  "There are GREEN mushrooms!  GREEN!"  He laughs.  "They're not red!  Go find me the green mushrooms and you can have a taste.  Eight green mushrooms for one red mushroom!
zh_mushroompatch_init,当你经过在地板上的时候，你注意到靴子似乎踩到了什么。你向脚下一看，发现目光所及之处，到处都是小而明亮的红色蘑菇。或者至少是两三米范围内——这里很黑。“等一下！等一下！”一张皱巴巴的脸顶着一头凌乱夸张的白发，从黑暗中探了出来。“这些是魔法蘑菇！我的魔法红蘑菇！”“嗯，好的……我能尝一个吗？”“不！我的蘑菇！但我知道一个秘密。他就偷偷靠在那里。”“那有绿~蘑菇！绿！”他大笑道。“它们可不是红色！给我去找绿蘑菇，你就可以尝尝。八个绿蘑菇换一个红蘑菇！”
en_mushroompatch_startquest,"Excellent!  Excellent!  Now let me show you how to find the mushrooms.  Look into my eyes.  Look very, very closely."  You do, and the inside of his eyes seem to spin.  For a moment, you want to look away, but you're transfixed, just staring.  Almost immediately, you snap out of it. \\n "All done!  Go find me those mushrooms!" \\n Simple enough.  But you feel surprisingly hungry...
zh_mushroompatch_startquest,“好耶！好耶！现在让我教你怎么找蘑菇。来，看着我的眼睛，非常，非常仔细地看。”你照做了。他的眼睛似乎在旋转。有那么一刻，你想要移开视线，但你已经呆住了，只能够盯着看。几乎是同一时间，你又振作了起来。\\n“完成了！去给我找那些蘑菇！”\\n简单至极。但你开始感到莫名的饥饿……

en_brainsucker_init,As you walk through the corridor, a ghostly door appears in front of you.  Brown wood, with a large brass knob, it shimmers before you.  When you reach a hand out, it passes through the wood.  Perplexed, you try the knob and it turns.  And then the world turns.

en_tavern_textp1,You take advantage of a brief moment of calm to rest.  As you close your eyes, you can barely make out a faint tune in the far distance.  This isn't unusual; bards hear disembodied music like most adventurers hear invisible voices, but you don't recognize the melody.  You start to hum, improvising an accompaniment.
